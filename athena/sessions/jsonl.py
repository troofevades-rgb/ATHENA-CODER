"""Append-only JSONL primitives for the session store.

JSONL is the canonical on-disk format: one JSON object per line, trailing
newline. ``read_jsonl`` is tolerant of malformed lines (logs and skips)
because a power-loss in the middle of an ``append_jsonl`` can leave a
partial line at the tail of the file, and we want recovery to be silent.

The optional ``ATHENA_SESSIONS_FSYNC=1`` env flag flushes after each write
— off by default because the hot path (every model turn) is latency-
sensitive and the loss window on crash is at most one turn. The legacy
``OCODE_SESSIONS_FSYNC`` is honored for one release.
