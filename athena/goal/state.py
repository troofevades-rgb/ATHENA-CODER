"""Goal state — the active-driver layer over the passive invariant (T5-07.2).

The passive `/goal` invariant (``goal.txt`` + system-prompt block)
shapes decisions but doesn't drive them. T5-07 adds an *active*
state alongside it: status, turn counter, exhaustion cap, ordered
subgoals.

Two on-disk files per profile:

  ``<profile_dir>/goal.txt``         human-editable objective text
  ``<profile_dir>/goal_state.json``  the machine-managed state

The split is deliberate. The text file stays a single line a human
can ``cat`` or edit; the state file carries the bookkeeping that
the continuation loop needs but the user shouldn't have to read.
Both can be deleted independently; the text file is the source of
truth for the *what*, the state file is the source of truth for
the *how much progress + can we continue*.

Achievement and blocked detection live in :mod:`athena.goal.loop`;
this module is data + persistence only.
