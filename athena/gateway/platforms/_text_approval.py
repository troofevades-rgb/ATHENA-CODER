"""Text-reply approval support for platforms without native buttons.

Signal / iMessage / Email don't have inline-button UI the way
Telegram / Slack / Discord do. They fall back to a text prompt
("Approve `Bash`? Reply with /allow or /deny.") and intercept the
user's next message.

Each adapter mixes :class:`TextApprovalState` in to track the
``(user_id) → request_id`` mapping and call
:func:`parse_approval_decision` on inbound text before it reaches
:meth:`handle_inbound`.

Why keyed on user_id: Signal/iMessage/Email all carry a stable
per-user identifier with every inbound message. Storing the pending
request id against that identifier means an unrelated chat member
typing ``/allow`` can't accidentally resolve someone else's
approval.
