"""Platform-neutral inbound and approval event records.

:class:`MessageEvent` is what every :class:`~athena.gateway.base.GatewayAdapter`
constructs from a platform-native payload before dispatching it into the
daemon. Keeping the shape platform-neutral is how the rest of the
gateway stays free of platform-specific code.

:class:`ApprovalRequest` is the in-flight record the daemon hands an
adapter when a dangerous tool wants user confirmation. The adapter
renders it via its platform's UI (Telegram inline buttons, Slack block
kit, Discord ``ui.View``) and reports the decision back through the
approval router.

The ``message_type`` field discriminates text / media events and is
what the base adapter's busy-session policy keys off: rapid text
follow-ups *interrupt* the in-flight turn (merged into a single pending
slot), while photo bursts *queue without interrupting* so an album
doesn't keep restarting the agent. Hermes Agent encodes the same rule;
the field exists so the policy is uniform across adapters.
