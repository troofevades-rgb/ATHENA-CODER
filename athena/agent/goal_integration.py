"""Goal-loop integration mixin for :class:`~athena.agent.core.Agent`.

R1 stage 1 pilot of the inheritance split. ``AgentGoalIntegration``
owns the agent-side goal hooks -- the after-turn continuation
decision (``_consult_goal_continuation``) and the best-effort state
persistence call (``_persist_goal_state``). Both methods stay
methods (no signature change) so the mixin slots into ``Agent``'s
MRO without touching any caller. Subsequent stages will pull the
lifecycle and runtime methods into their own mixins the same way.

This module intentionally has no imports of :mod:`athena.agent.core`
-- the mixin is loaded by ``core`` itself when it builds the
``Agent`` class. The TYPE_CHECKING-only block keeps the type
annotations on attributes accessed via ``self`` accurate without
introducing a circular import.
