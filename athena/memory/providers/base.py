"""MemoryProvider ABC and the universal :class:`MemoryEntry` record.

A ``MemoryProvider`` is the contract for every persistent memory backend. The
built-in :class:`BuiltinFileProvider` is the default and stores memories as
Markdown files under ``<profile_dir>/memory/`` with a SQLite mirror for
ordered/queried reads. Alternate providers (Honcho, Mem0, byterover, etc.)
can be plugged in via the plugin system.

Provider methods are keyed by ``profile`` so a single provider instance can
serve every profile under ``~/.athena/profiles/<name>/``.

Provider implementations should be stateless across sessions. Per-session
state lives in :meth:`on_session_start` / :meth:`on_session_end`.
