"""Provider abstraction (Phase 8).

The agent talks to one or more model backends through a uniform
:class:`Provider` interface. Each backend (Ollama, Anthropic, OpenAI,
Google, OpenRouter, Nous, generic OpenAI-compat) is a subclass that
registers itself via :func:`register_provider`. A model name (plus
optional config routing) is resolved to a provider instance at agent
startup by :func:`runtime_resolver.resolve_provider` (added in
Prompt 8.6).

Importing :mod:`athena.providers` registers every built-in provider as a
side effect so the registry is fully populated by the time the agent
asks for one.
