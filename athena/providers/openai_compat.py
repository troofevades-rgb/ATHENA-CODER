"""Generic OpenAI-compatible provider.

Many local and hosted inference servers expose an OpenAI-shaped
``/chat/completions`` endpoint: vLLM, llama.cpp's server, TabbyAPI, LM
Studio, Ollama's own ``/v1`` shim, and the long tail of self-hosted
gateways. The only thing that varies is the base URL and whether an
API key is required.

This provider takes both as constructor arguments and otherwise
inherits all behavior from :class:`OpenAICompatibleProvider` (the
SSE-parsing base in :mod:`athena.providers.openai`).
