"""``/goal`` + ``/subgoal`` — set / drive / inspect the goal (T5-07.4).

Two interactive commands sharing the goal state in
``<profile_dir>/goal.txt`` + ``<profile_dir>/goal_state.json``.

``/goal`` subcommands:

  /goal <text>      set/replace the goal (status=active, turns_taken=0)
  /goal             show text + status + turns + subgoals (alias: status)
  /goal status      same as bare /goal
  /goal pause       stop the continuation loop (status=paused)
  /goal resume      restart the loop; if exhausted, grant another
                    cfg.goal_max_turns on top of turns_taken
  /goal clear       remove goal.txt + goal_state.json

``/subgoal`` subcommands:

  /subgoal <text>   append a subgoal (advisory only)
  /subgoal done     mark the first not-done subgoal complete

After any mutation the agent's in-memory system prompt is
rebuilt via ``agent.reload_goal()`` so the change takes effect
without requiring ``/clear``.
