- Cron output delivery to `log`, `file:<path>`, or `gateway://...` (gateway stub until Phase 10) (Phase 6)

- `/goal` Ralph-loop invariant persisted at `<profile_dir>/goal.txt` and injected at the end of every system prompt rebuild (Phase 6)
- `ocode cron {add,list,remove,enable,disable,run-now,logs,daemon}` CLI (Phase 6)

- Bundled `shell_audit` plugin (Phase 5)
- `ocode plugins {list,enable,disable,info}` CLI (Phase 5)

- Per-thread approval callback for safe fork execution (Phase 0)
- tool check_fn for capability-based tool advertisement (Phase 0)
- agentskills.io-compliant skill format (Phase 1)
- Skill state machine (active/stale/archived) (Phase 1)
- Pinning and archive directory (Phase 1)
- Class-level umbrella architecture (references/templates/scripts) (Phase 1)
- skills_list, skill_view, skill_manage tools (Phase 1)
- ocode import-from-hermes for Hermes Agent migration (Phase 1)
- Progressive disclosure of skill catalog in system prompt (Phase 1)
- SessionStore with JSONL persistence and SQLite FTS5 mirror (Phase 2)
- SearchSessions tool for recall (Phase 2)
- ocode sessions {list,browse,search,purge} CLI (Phase 2)
- ocode reindex command for rebuilding the session FTS5 index (Phase 2)
- Per-profile root at ~/.ocode/profiles/<profile>/ (Phase 2)
- Complete Agent.fork() with auxiliary client and stdout/stderr capture (Phase 3)
- Post-write delta lint for .py / .pyi / .json / .yaml / .yml / .toml (Phase 3)
- ForkResult.actions extracted from structured tool results (Phase 3)
- Parent/child session lineage with fork-tree CLI browse (Phase 3)
- Per-turn background review fork (Phase 4)
- Curator with structured YAML output (Phase 4)
- Curator dry-run mode and run reports (run.json + REPORT.md) (Phase 4)
- Deterministic lifecycle transitions at session start (Phase 4)
- .curator_state persistence (Phase 4)
- Provenance enforcement in skill_manage by write_origin (Phase 4)
- ocode curator {run, status, pause, resume, inspect-last} CLI (Phase 4)

### Changed
- `apscheduler>=3.10` + `sqlalchemy>=2.0` added as runtime dependencies (Phase 6)
- Agent loop drains pending steers via `_inject_pending_steers()` before each user prompt (Phase 6)
- `build_system_prompt` accepts an optional `goal` parameter and appends the invariant block last (Phase 6)
- `ocode/memory.py` refactored into the `ocode/memory/` package; legacy workspace-keyed API preserved (Phase 5)
- Agent loop fires plugin lifecycle hooks (`on_session_start`, `on_user_message`, `pre_tool_call`, `post_tool_call`, `on_assistant_message`, `on_session_end`); the existing settings.json hook system in `ocode/hooks.py` is unchanged and runs alongside (Phase 5)
- Sub-agent dispatch tool now calls Agent.fork() under the hood
- ocode/agent.py split into ocode/agent/{core,fork}.py
- ocode/skills/ (slash-command handlers) renamed to ocode/commands/ to free
  the name for the new file-based skill format
- Agent.run_turn now persists every user / assistant / tool message to the
  session store (JSONL + SQLite FTS5)
- Hermes sessions_importer drives SessionStore so imports land in
  `ocode sessions list` and FTS5 search
