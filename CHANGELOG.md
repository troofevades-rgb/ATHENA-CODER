### Changed
- Sub-agent dispatch tool now calls Agent.fork() under the hood
- ocode/agent.py split into ocode/agent/{core,fork}.py
- ocode/skills/ (slash-command handlers) renamed to ocode/commands/ to free
  the name for the new file-based skill format
- Agent.run_turn now persists every user / assistant / tool message to the
  session store (JSONL + SQLite FTS5)
- Hermes sessions_importer drives SessionStore so imports land in
  `ocode sessions list` and FTS5 search
