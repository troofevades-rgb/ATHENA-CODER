# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- (Future work lands here.)

### TODO before tagging v0.2.0
- _Finish T1-04 agent core test suite._ Sub-prompts .1–.3 landed in
  `edd496f` (plan doc, FakeProvider scaffold, 3 Agent-init tests).
  Sub-prompts .4–.8 (`run_turn`, `run_until_done`, fork, auxiliary
  client, coverage finalize) are pending; per the Tier 1 ROADMAP
  they land **after** T1-06/07/08 so the tests assert against
  post-security agent behaviour rather than re-baselining later.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-05-19

### Added

- `athena --version` flag reading `athena.__version__` (single source of truth via `scripts/verify_version.py` CI gate) (T1-02)
- `pytest-cov>=4.1` + `pytest-timeout>=2.3` in `[project.optional-dependencies].dev`; pytest configured with `timeout=60` so hung tests fail loudly instead of wedging CI runners (T1-01)
- `CHANGELOG.md` reorganized to [Keep-a-Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) format with `## [Unreleased]` + `## [0.2.0]` versioned sections; `RELEASE_v0.2.0.md` at repo root summarizes the release for the GitHub Releases UI; `docs/internal/release-process.md` is the operator checklist (T1-03)
- _(planned; lands as T1-04 ships)_ Agent core unit test suite under `tests/agent/` covering `core.run_until_done`, `fork.Agent.fork()`, `auxiliary_client` (T1-04)
- _(planned; lands as T1-07 ships)_ Path security module sandboxing file operations to the workspace; outside-workspace writes require explicit approval (T1-07)
- _(planned; lands as T1-08 ships)_ SSRF defense on the web tool: blocks RFC1918, link-local, loopback, and cloud-metadata IPs by default (T1-08)
- **PyPI publishing via trusted publishing** (T1-02) — `.github/workflows/publish.yml` fires on every `v*` git tag push. Builds sdist + wheel once, then routes the artifacts to TestPyPI (for `v*-rc*` / `v*-beta*` / `v*-alpha*` tags via PEP 440 pre-release detection) or real PyPI (for everything else). Uses OIDC trusted publishing — no `PYPI_API_TOKEN` secret in repo settings. Both publish jobs target named GitHub environments (`testpypi` / `pypi`) so a maintainer can optionally pin a manual-approval gate per release. `workflow_dispatch` inputs let you re-run a failed publish without burning a fresh tag.
- **Project metadata for PyPI** — `pyproject.toml` now carries `readme`, `license` ("MIT"), `license-files`, `authors`, `keywords`, `classifiers`, and `[project.urls]` (Homepage, Repository, Issues, Changelog). Distribution name is `athena-coder` because both `athena` and `athena-agent` are taken on PyPI by unrelated active projects; the import name and CLI shims (`athena`, `ocode`) are unchanged.
- **LICENSE file** — MIT, 2026.
- **`docs/release.md`** — operator runbook covering the one-time PyPI / TestPyPI trusted-publisher registration, the standard release flow (`git tag v0.2.1 && git push origin v0.2.1`), pre-release staging via `*rc*` tags, manual re-dispatch on flaky publish, and yank/rollback procedure.

- **GitHub Actions CI** (T1-01) — five workflows running on every push to `master` and every PR: `tests.yml` (pytest matrix on Python 3.10/3.11/3.12/3.13), `lint.yml` (ruff check + ruff format --check, with mypy strict landing as advisory until the T1-04 cleanup), `coverage.yml` (pytest --cov; gates the build at 60%, current floor is 75%), `osv-scanner.yml` (google/osv-scanner-action reusable workflow on push + weekly Monday 08:00 UTC), `supply-chain.yml` (pip-audit, advisory-only for now). Each workflow has a `concurrency` group that cancels in-progress runs on new pushes to the same PR. Test workflow uses `fail-fast: false` so one Python version's failure doesn't hide others. No secrets referenced.
- **Dependabot** (`.github/dependabot.yml`) — weekly pip + github-actions bumps. Dev-tool updates (ruff, mypy, pytest*) grouped into one PR so unrelated bumps don't flood the queue. Limit 5 open PRs at a time.
- **README CI badges** — five SVG status badges immediately under the H1 linking to each workflow page on Actions.
- `pytest-cov>=4.1` in `[project.optional-dependencies].dev`.

- **Mechanical safety subsystem (Phase 17)** — content-addressed snapshot store, mutation audit log, ContextVar-scoped approval guard, word-boundary shell allowlist with denylist. Every agent-driven mutation (skill_manage, memory writes, background-fork tool calls) now wraps in a snapshot+audit context so any change is byte-exact rollback-able and forensically attributable. Snapshot tarballs are stored under `~/.athena/snapshots/YYYY/MM/DD/<ts>-<sha[:12]>-<origin>.tar.gz` with a sidecar JSON carrying `snapshot_id`, `write_origin`, `session_id`, `tool_name`, `tool_call_id`, `paths`, `created_at`, `athena_version`, `parent_session_id`, and pin state. Identical pre-states under the same write_origin at the same second collapse to one tarball (content addressing).
- **Append-only mutation audit log** at `~/.athena/audit/mutations-YYYY-MM.jsonl` — one compact JSON line per mutation with `timestamp`, `write_origin`, `session_id`, `parent_session_id`, `tool_name`, `tool_call_id`, `path`, `snapshot_id`, `sha_before`, `sha_after`, `byte_delta`. `threading.Lock` serialises appends; monthly rollover; existing files preserved across appends. (Phase 17.4)
- **ContextVar-scoped approval guard** (`athena.safety.approval_guard`) — foreground prompts cache approvals per-resource for the lifetime of the ContextVar scope. `Agent.fork()` now installs `scope_fresh_approvals()` so a background fork starts with an empty grant cache and any `request_approval` call from background origin raises `ApprovalDeniedInBackground` (unless the resource is explicitly marked `auto_approve_in_background=True`). The cache is never consulted from background even if a foreground grant for the same resource exists. (Phase 17.2)
- **Word-boundary shell policy** (`athena.safety.shell_policy`) replaces the previous substring allowlist. Allowlist entries compile to `^<escaped-entry>\b` and match the binary token after stripping environment-variable assignments — so `git` no longer matches `gitlab-cli` or `.git/hooks/...`. Always-on denylist covers `rm -rf` of system roots, `dd of=/dev/...`, `mkfs.*`, fork bomb, `chmod 777 /`, `sudo rm -rf`, `curl | sh`, `wget | sh`, and block-device redirects. Extendable via `cfg.bash_extra_denylist`. The Bash tool calls `evaluate_denylist_only()` before execution and returns a `BLOCKED by shell policy: <reason>` tool error on match. (Phase 17.3)
- **Rollback CLI** — `athena snapshot {list, show, pin, unpin, prune}` for store inspection; `athena skill {diff, rollback} <name>` and `athena memory {diff, rollback} <name>` for restoring a single resource. Rollbacks are themselves audited (the post-restore record carries `tool_name="skill_rollback"` / `"memory_rollback"`, sha_before/sha_after inverting the original change). `--to <snapshot_id>` selects a specific snapshot; `-y` skips the interactive confirm. (Phase 17.6)
- **Per-profile snapshot/audit singletons** (`athena.safety.context`) — `get_snapshot_store(profile_dir)` and `get_audit_log(profile_dir)` lazily construct one store per profile root, keyed by resolved path so two concurrent profiles in the same process see their own directories. Re-resolves home each call so tests that monkeypatch `Path.home()` get tmp-scoped stores. (Phase 17.5)
- **CI grep guard** at `tests/safety/test_no_raw_writes.py` — walks `athena/` and fails the build if any module that isn't on the snapshot+audit allowlist calls `Path.write_text`, `Path.write_bytes`, `open(..., "w"|"a")`, `shutil.copy*`, or `shutil.rmtree`. The allowlist is frozen as of Phase 17.5; new write sites must route through `athena.safety.mutation.snapshot_and_record` or get an explicit one-line justification in the allowlist. (Phase 17.5)
- `cfg.bash_extra_denylist: list[str]` config field for appending regex patterns to the default shell denylist. (Phase 17.3)
- `athena.safety.mutation.snapshot_and_record(paths, *, tool_name, ...)` — combined context manager that takes the pre-state snapshot, captures `sha_before`/byte size per path, yields a `MutationContext`, and lets the caller emit the matching `MutationRecord` via `ctx.record(path)` once the mutation is complete. Used at every skill/memory mutation site. (Phase 17.5)

- **Observability plugin (bundled, opt-in)** — OpenTelemetry tracing + metrics + JSON structured logging under `athena/plugins/bundled/observability/`. Activate with `athena plugins enable observability`. Heavy OTel deps live behind `pip install -e ".[observability]"` so headless installs stay light. Spans: `athena.session` brackets every session; `athena.tool_call.<name>` per tool dispatch with arguments redacted; latency + count metrics tagged by `tool_name`. When `[plugins.observability].otlp_endpoint` is set, exports via OTLP/HTTP instead of the default stderr console exporter. Plugin loads and no-ops cleanly when the optional deps aren't installed. (Phase 16)
- **PII redaction** for span attributes — pattern table for OpenAI / Anthropic / Google / GitHub (classic + fine-grained `ghu`/`ghs`/`ghr`/`gho`) / Bearer / Slack tokens; constant-time replacement with `<redacted>`; length truncation at 200 chars with `…` suffix; defensive handling of non-dict / None inputs. (Phase 16)
- **`/status` slash command + `athena status` CLI** — read-only view of live counters (per-tool histogram, fork / review / curator counts, prompt/completion tokens, elapsed). Snapshot is atomically written to `<profile>/.status.json` on every turn end; the CLI reads it from any terminal and is profile-aware (`--profile` flag honored). The renderer (`render_status`) is shared between the two surfaces so they stay byte-identical. (Phase 16)
- **Benchmark harness** at `scripts/bench/` — `runner.py` discovers any module exporting `run() -> dict`, runs them, writes JSON results, optionally compares against a baseline and flags regressions over a configurable threshold (default 10%). Ships with `tool_call_latency` (Read tool dispatch) and `skill_discovery` (100-skill catalog walk) reproducible benches. Initial baseline committed at `tests/fixtures/benchmarks/baselines/main.json`. (Phase 16)
- `[observability]` optional extras group (`opentelemetry-sdk`, `opentelemetry-exporter-otlp-proto-http`, `python-json-logger`). (Phase 16)
- `Stats.tool_call_counts`, `Stats.fork_count`, `Stats.review_fired_count`, `Stats.curator_run_count`, `Stats.record_tool_call`, `Stats.to_snapshot`. `Agent.write_status_snapshot()` atomic writer fired at every `_fire_stop`. (Phase 16)

- **Webhook HTTP listener** — `aiohttp`-backed at `http://<host>:<port>/webhook/<id>` hosted inside the gateway daemon when `[gateway.webhooks].enabled = true`. Per-request flow: subscription lookup (404 on miss/disabled) → auth (HMAC-SHA256 or Bearer, 401 on fail; `auth_type="none"` for trusted networks) → idempotency cache (200 no-op on duplicate `X-Webhook-Idempotency-Key` within 10 min TTL) → per-webhook 60s sliding-window rate limit (429 over) → JSON body parse (non-JSON wraps with `_raw_body` or `_raw_body_base64`) → async `asyncio.create_task` dispatch → 202 returned immediately. `GET /health` for operator probes. (Phase 15)
- **Webhook→skill and webhook→prompt-template bindings** — skill binding fires a `Run the <skill> skill` template with payload + filtered headers (X-GitHub-Event etc.) as JSON code blocks; auth headers stripped. Prompt template binding substitutes `{{ payload }}` / `{{ headers }}` (whitespace-tolerant). Each fire spawns a one-off Agent (stateless — no session pooling). (Phase 15)
- **Delivery routing** for webhook responses: `log` / `none` / `file:<path>` (append with `--- webhook <id> <iso-ts> ---` delimiters, parent dirs auto-created) / `gateway://<platform>/<chat_id>` (routes through the running daemon's adapter). Missing daemon / missing adapter / malformed target / send failure all log without raising. (Phase 15)
- **Idempotency keys + sliding-window rate limiting** per webhook. Idempotency cache keyed on `(webhook_id, key)` so the same idempotency value across different webhooks doesn't collide; lazy-purge implementation, thread-safe under contention. Rate limiter per id so one noisy webhook hitting its budget doesn't starve others. (Phase 15)
- **HMAC compare uses `hmac.compare_digest`** (constant-time). Accepts both `X-Webhook-Signature: <hex>` (athena native) and `X-Hub-Signature-256: sha256=<hex>` (GitHub) so the same URL serves a GitHub repo and a custom client without operator-side branching. (Phase 15)
- `athena webhook {add, list, info, remove, enable, disable, test}` CLI. `add` auto-generates a 32-byte hex secret when `--secret` is omitted (HMAC/Bearer modes). `test <id>` POSTs a synthetic (or `--payload-file`-supplied) payload to the configured URL, signed per the webhook's `auth_type`; surfaces the HTTP response so the operator can verify auth + dispatch work end-to-end before pointing a real source at the URL. (Phase 15)
- `aiohttp>=3.9` added to `[gateway]` extras explicitly. (Phase 15)
- `[gateway.webhooks]` config section: `enabled` (default False — opt-in), `host` (default 127.0.0.1), `port` (default 4747). (Phase 15)

- **Multi-profile isolation** under `~/.athena/profiles/<name>/`. Each profile is its own configuration, skill set, memory, session store, cron schedule, gateway routes, MCP server set, and goal — `personal` and `work` run side-by-side without crosstalk. Sessions in one profile can't be searched from another; memory and skills the same. (Phase 14)
- `athena profile {list, show, create, switch, delete, rename}` CLI — `create` supports `--copy-from <name>` to clone an existing profile's contents wholesale; `delete` requires a confirm-token equal to the profile name (anti-typo); `default` is protected against delete and rename. (Phase 14)
- `--profile <name>` global flag + `ATHENA_PROFILE` env var (legacy `OCODE_PROFILE` honored). Resolution precedence: CLI flag > env var > `~/.athena/active_profile` file (set by `athena profile switch`) > `cfg.profile` from config.toml > hardcoded `"default"`. Invalid names at any step fall through to the next source rather than crashing. (Phase 14)
- One-time migration of legacy single-profile layout — items at the top of `~/.athena/` (skills, memory, sessions, sessions.db, mcp.json, goal.txt, cron.db, gateway.db, training_state.json, labels/, datasets/, models/, config.toml) move into `~/.athena/profiles/default/` on the first invocation after upgrade. Per-item failure isolation (one bad move logs + continues with the rest). Idempotent (the presence of `profiles/` after a successful run permanently short-circuits the check). (Phase 14)
- Strict profile name validation: lowercase alphanumerics + `_` + `-`, must start with an alphanumeric, max 64 chars. Rejects path traversal, shell-special chars, uppercase, leading hyphens/underscores. (Phase 14)

- **ACP server for IDE integration** — `athena acp serve` exposes athena over JSON-RPC 2.0 stdio, the Agent Client Protocol that Zed natively supports (VS Code / JetBrains have community adapters). `ACPServer` handles framing, request/notification dispatch with per-message asyncio.Task parallelism, and client-bound `send_request` with pending-future tracking + timeout. Shutdown drains in-flight dispatches with a 5s grace then cancels, and resolves every pending client-bound future with `ACPError` so callers in `permission_request` unwind rather than hang. (Phase 13)
- `StreamingSender` — typed wrapper around `send_notification` for the ACP streaming primitives: `text_block_start` / `text_delta` / `text_block_stop`, `tool_call_start` / `tool_call_result`, `permission_request` (returns `"deny"` on any failure path: timeout, IDE error, malformed response, unknown decision), `turn_started` / `turn_completed`. (Phase 13)
- ACP method handlers via `register(server, agent_factory)`: `initialize` (returns capabilities), `session/new` (mint or use caller-supplied id, instantiate Agent in a worker thread), `session/end` (close in thread), `session/send_message` (run agent in `asyncio.to_thread`, stream final response, surface every tool_call_trace entry as a `tool_use` block, bridge approvals via `run_coroutine_threadsafe` into the loop), `session/cancel` (sets `Agent.cancel_pending`), `session/slash_command`, `models/list`. (Phase 13)
- ACP slash commands: `/steer`, `/queue` (+ `/queue clear`), `/goal` (set / show / clear) via the same `GLOBAL_STEER_QUEUE` and goal-invariant primitives the CLI's REPL slash commands use. (Phase 13)
- `Agent.cancel_pending` flag — checked between tool rounds in `_run_turn_inner`; cleared at the start of every new `run_turn`. Allows ACP `session/cancel` to abort an in-flight turn at the next safe boundary. (Phase 13)
- `athena acp serve` / `athena acp install-zed` CLI — `serve` is what the IDE spawns over stdio; `install-zed` prints the Zed `agent_servers` settings.json snippet. (Phase 13)

- **MCP HTTP/SSE transport** — `SSETransport` runs a synchronous façade over an async SSE listener + POST `/messages` channel. Auto-handles the legacy MCP SSE protocol's `event: endpoint` frame, dispatches JSON-RPC responses by id to pending sync waiters via a daemon-thread event loop, reconnects with exponential backoff (1s → 30s) on stream failure, refreshes the OAuth token in place on 401. Public API mirrors `MCPStdioClient` so the rest of athena's MCP code is transport-agnostic. (Phase 12)
- **OAuth 2.1 PKCE flow** (`athena/mcp/oauth.py`) — code verifier + S256 challenge, local one-shot HTTP callback on `127.0.0.1:<free-port>`, state validation for CSRF defense, code-for-token exchange + refresh-token grant with preservation of the prior refresh_token / scope when the provider omits them. `webbrowser.open` for the auth URL with stderr fallback. Token persistence at `~/.athena/mcp_tokens/<server_id>.json` with atomic writes (tempfile + os.replace) and POSIX mode 0600. `needs_refresh` proactive 2-minute grace window. Path-traversal-safe server_id handling. (Phase 12)
- **Transport resolver** (`athena/mcp/transport_resolver.py`) — `open_transport(server_id, config)` dispatches on the `transport` field of an mcp.json entry: `stdio` (default; constructs `MCPStdioClient`), `sse` / `http` / `http+sse` (constructs `SSETransport`, with optional OAuth config parsed from `config["oauth"]`). Loader refactored to use the resolver — existing stdio entries unaffected. (Phase 12)
- `athena mcp {list, auth, token-status, revoke, test}` CLI — operator surface for managing MCP HTTP/SSE servers. `auth` runs the OAuth flow; `token-status` humanizes expiry per server; `revoke` deletes stored tokens; `test` initializes one server and dumps its tool catalog for first-run validation. (Phase 12)

- `SignalAdapter` — Signal via signal-cli-rest-api (Docker-deployable bridge). HTTP-only; no new Python dep. Long-poll `/v1/receive`, post to `/v2/send`, base64 attachments. Text-reply approvals via `/allow` / `/deny` keyed on the sender's UUID. Exponential reconnect backoff. (Phase 11)
- `IMessageAdapter` — iMessage via BlueBubbles Server (macOS-host bridge). Socket.IO inbound via `python-socketio[asyncio_client]`, REST outbound. Handles chatGuid / handle.address normalization for both DM and group threads. Eager attachment download. Text-reply approvals. (Phase 11)
- `MatrixAdapter` — Matrix via `matrix-nio`. Reaction-based approval UI (✅ Allow / ✖ Deny) with the prompt event_id tracked back to the request id; pre-seeded reactions so users see them as tappable. E2EE supported when `matrix-nio[e2e]` (libolm) is installed; gracefully falls back to unencrypted-only otherwise. Per-profile `matrix_store/` for key persistence. Native typing notifications. (Phase 11)
- `EmailAdapter` — IMAP IDLE + SMTP via `aioimaplib` + `aiosmtplib`. text/plain preferred over text/html; HTML flattened via `beautifulsoup4` with scripts and styles stripped. Threading via `In-Reply-To` and `References` headers tracked per sender. Optional `allowed_senders` allowlist (canonical-address comparison). Approvals via `/allow` / `/deny` in the reply body. (Phase 11)
- `TextApprovalState` mixin — shared keyed (user_id → request_id) pending-approval store + `parse_approval_decision` token parser (`/allow`, `/deny`, ✅, ✖, yes, no, single-token only) for the three text-only platforms (Signal, iMessage, Email). (Phase 11)
- `athena gateway run` CLI extended to recognize all four new platforms; per-platform required-key validation reports missing settings with a clear message and skips the adapter without taking the gateway down. (Phase 11)
- `[gateway]` extras group extended: `python-socketio[asyncio_client]>=5.10` (iMessage), `matrix-nio[e2e]>=0.24` (Matrix), `aioimaplib>=2.0`, `aiosmtplib>=3.0`, `beautifulsoup4>=4.12` (Email). (Phase 11)
- `GatewayDaemon` — single asyncio-based daemon hosting platform adapters, exposing the agent to messaging platforms. Owns the session router, agent pool, approval router, and continuity manager. ``athena gateway run`` boots it in foreground. (Phase 10)
- `GatewayAdapter` base class with Hermes-faithful reliability primitives: `_active_sessions: dict[asyncio.Event]` guards + `_session_tasks: dict[asyncio.Task]` owner map, race-free guard install before `create_task`, stale-lock self-heal via `task.done()` (Hermes issue #11016), single `_pending_messages` slot with text-merging (issue #4469), interrupt-on-text vs queue-on-photo policy, bypass-command routing (`/stop|/new|/reset|/approve|/deny|/status|/restart`), command-scoped guard handoff preserving response ordering (Hermes PR #4926). (Phase 10)
- `SessionRouter` — SQLite-backed `gateway_routes` table at `<profile>/gateway.db`. Sticky `(platform, chat_id, user_id) → session_id` routing; routes persist across daemon restarts; `last_seen_at` bumps on every reuse. (Phase 10)
- `AgentPool` — async bounded LRU cache of warm Agents. Per-session instantiation locks ensure concurrent `get()` for the same id share one factory invocation; concurrent gets for different ids run in parallel. Eviction calls `Agent.close()`. (Phase 10)
- `ApprovalRouter` — async + sync bridge for dangerous-tool approvals. `request_async` (loop side) returns the user's decision via `asyncio.Future`; `request_sync` (agent worker thread side) submits via `run_coroutine_threadsafe` and blocks on `concurrent.futures.Future`. Per-platform renderer dispatch via `register_platform_renderer(platform, renderer)`. 300s default timeout with `"deny"` as safe fallback. `cancel_all` unblocks every waiter on shutdown. (Phase 10)
- `ContinuityManager` — bulk cross-platform user linking. `link_canonical(canonical_id, {platform: pid, ...})` is atomic; `unlink_canonical` drops all bindings for a user. Routing path uses these so a Telegram + Slack pair linked to the same canonical user lands on one session. (Phase 10)
- `TelegramAdapter` (aiogram>=3) — long-polling, inline-keyboard approval buttons, eager attachment download to `<profile>/gateway_attachments/telegram/<chat>/`, Markdown body rendering. (Phase 10)
- `SlackAdapter` (slack-sdk>=3.27 Socket Mode) — no public HTTPS endpoint required, Block Kit primary/danger approval buttons, bot-self filtering via `auth.test`-discovered `_bot_user_id`, file download via httpx with the bot token in Authorization. (Phase 10)
- `DiscordAdapter` (discord.py>=2.4) — `discord.ui.View` approval buttons (callbacks bound to methods, not opaque strings), `Intents.message_content` enabled, `/athena` slash command via `app_commands.CommandTree`, `channel.typing()` for indicators. (Phase 10)
- Gateway agent factory (`build_agent_factory`) — pool factory that constructs an Agent bound to the daemon's shared SessionStore, replays the session's JSONL into `Agent.messages`, returns warm. (Phase 10)
- `Agent.resume_session_id` constructor kwarg + `Agent.load_history_from_session(session_id)` method for gateway resume. (Phase 10)
- `_process_message_background` impl — pool warm, typing-heartbeat task, gateway-bridge approval callback installed via ContextVar (copied into the worker thread by `asyncio.to_thread`), `agent.run_until_done` on the worker, final response chunked on paragraph/sentence/word boundaries and sent back, pending drain into a fresh task. (Phase 10)
- In-process `gateway.registry` — keyed by profile, populated on `daemon.start`. Used by cron's gateway-delivery path to find the daemon without IPC. (Phase 10)
- `athena gateway {run, routes, link, unlink, canonical-users}` CLI subcommands. (Phase 10)
- `[gateway]` optional dependencies group (aiogram, slack-sdk, discord.py) so headless installs don't pull SDKs. (Phase 10)
- `GatewayConfig` — `max_warm_agents` (50 default), `continuity` (off default), `platforms` per-adapter credentials dict. (Phase 10)

- Per-(provider, model_glob) tool-call parser registry under `athena/providers/parsers/` — first-match-wins with `register()` and provider-default fallthrough via `register_default()`; `resolve_parser(provider, model)` returns the function `Provider.parse_tool_calls` delegates to (Phase 9)
- Native-format parsers: `anthropic_xml` (content-block array → text + tool_use), `openai_function` (legacy `function_call` for gpt-3.5*/gpt-4-0613), `openai_tools` (current `tool_calls` for gpt-4*/4o/o1/o3/o4 and every OpenAI-compatible service), `ollama_native` (provider-default for Ollama) (Phase 9)
- Content-leak recovery parsers: `qwen_xml_leakage` (`<tool_call>{...}</tool_call>` XML), `harmony` (GPT-OSS three-channel analysis/commentary/final), `code_fenced_json` (` ```json ``` ` blocks), `json_block` (whole-content bare JSON) — model-specific globs route Qwen and GPT-OSS variants to the right parser regardless of host provider (Phase 9)
- `fallback_parser` — last-resort native `tool_calls` extractor that never raises and tolerates malformed JSON args, non-dict tool calls, missing names, and non-string IDs (Phase 9)
- Agent loop recovers leaked tool calls from streamed text via `_recover_tool_calls_from_text`, which calls `provider.parse_tool_calls` first and falls through to the generic recovery only on hard failure (Phase 9)
- Parser fixture corpus at `tests/fixtures/tool_call_outputs/<provider>/<model>/{normal,content_leakage,malformed}/` + parametrized corpus-driven test asserting every parser reproduces the captured `.expected.json` (Phase 9)
- Fuzz test: 12 (provider, model) combos × 1000 random strings + 200 random nested raw_response dicts, fixed seed, asserting parsers never raise and always return well-shaped output (Phase 9)
- `Provider` ABC, `StreamChunk` shape, and name-keyed registry under `athena/providers/` (Phase 8)
- `OllamaProvider` (replaces `OllamaClient`) on the new ABC; `ollama_client.py` is now a back-compat shim (Phase 8)
- `AnthropicProvider`, `OpenAIProvider`, `GoogleProvider` first-class providers with respx-mocked SSE parsing (Phase 8)
- `OpenAICompatProvider`, `OpenRouterProvider`, `NousProvider` — thin OpenAI-compat subclasses for vLLM/llama.cpp/openrouter.ai/portal.nousresearch.com (Phase 8)
- `CredentialPool` at `~/.athena/credentials.json` — per-provider round-robin with cooldown on 429, atomic JSON persistence, thread-safe, redacted listing (Phase 8)
- `resolve_provider(model, cfg, pool)` runtime resolver — prefix routing (anthropic/ openai/ google/ openrouter/ nous/), gemini- bare prefix, host:port/model → openai_compat, default ollama (Phase 8)
- Provider fallback chain via `providers.<primary>.fallback = ["openrouter", ...]` — resolver walks the chain when the primary has no credential or every credential is in 429 cooldown. Entries can be bare provider names (model string passes through) or `{provider, model}` dicts for cases where the model name needs to change too (Phase 8)
- `athena providers {list,test,add-key,remove-key,models}` CLI (Phase 8)
- `list_models()` on every hosted provider — `athena providers models <name>` queries the live catalog so users don't guess at stale model names (Phase 8)
- `respx>=0.21` added to `[dev]` extras for httpx mocking in provider tests (Phase 8)
- Trajectory extraction + auto-classifier (`good` / `bad` / `preference_pair` / `unreviewed`) (Phase 7)
- Trajectory extraction + auto-classifier (`good` / `bad` / `preference_pair` / `unreviewed`) (Phase 7)

### Changed
- _(planned; lands as T1-02.7 ships)_ README install instructions point at `pip install athena-coder` from PyPI (T1-02)
- _(planned; lands as T1-05 ships)_ README MCP transport section reflects HTTP/SSE + OAuth shipped in Phase 12 (T1-05)
- _(planned; lands as T1-05 ships)_ Modelfile.troof-coder system prompt: `ocode` → `athena` (T1-05)

### Removed
- Legacy `ocode` console-script alias from `pyproject.toml` `[project.scripts]`. Update any shell aliases or scripts that called `ocode` to call `athena` instead. (T1-02)

### Security
- _(planned; lands as T1-06 ships)_ Credential file writes use `os.open(O_EXCL, 0o600)` atomically, closing the TOCTOU window between file creation and chmod (T1-06)
- _(planned; lands as T1-06 ships)_ TOCTOU windows closed across `credential_pool.py`, `mcp/oauth.py`, and any auth/token write paths (T1-06)
- _(planned; lands as T1-07 ships)_ `file_ops.py` reads and writes validate workspace boundary before opening the file (T1-07)
- _(planned; lands as T1-08 ships)_ `web.py` blocks SSRF-prone destination IPs by default (RFC1918, link-local, loopback, cloud-metadata) (T1-08)


- Project renamed `ocode` → `athena`. The Python package, the `athena`
  CLI command, `~/.athena/` config home, and the `ATHENA.md` project
  context file all move together. The legacy `ocode` CLI entry stays
  as an alias for one release; `~/.athena/` falls back to reading
  `~/.ocode/` when the new home doesn't exist; `ATHENA.md` falls back
  to `OCODE.md`; `OCODE_*` env vars (`MODEL`, `SESSIONS_FSYNC`,
  `SEARCH_BACKEND`, `SEARXNG_URL`, `WEB_TIMEOUT`, `WEB_USER_AGENT`,
  `HOOK_EVENT`, `TOOL_NAME`) are still honored alongside the canonical
  `ATHENA_*`.

- Legacy `~/.athena/{skills, memory, sessions, ...}` now live under `~/.athena/profiles/default/`. Auto-migrated on first run; no operator action required. `credentials.json`, `mcp_tokens/`, `plugins/`, `plugins_state.json`, `logs/` deliberately stay at `~/.athena/` (user-scope, not profile-scope) — a user's API key is a user resource, and cooldown state shared globally mirrors upstream rate-limit reality more accurately than per-profile isolation would. (Phase 14)
- Forks inherit the parent's `profile` field via `dataclasses.replace`. The invariant is now locked in by a regression test (`test_fork_inherits_parent_profile`). (Phase 14)

- `cron.delivery` — `gateway://<platform>/<chat_id>` delivery target now dispatches through the running `GatewayDaemon`'s adapter via the in-process registry. Falls back to log on missing daemon / missing adapter / loop not running. (Phase 10)

- `tomli-w>=1.0` added as a runtime dep (used by `athena model switch`) (Phase 7)
- `apscheduler>=3.10` + `sqlalchemy>=2.0` added as runtime dependencies (Phase 6)
- Agent loop drains pending steers via `_inject_pending_steers()` before each user prompt (Phase 6)
- `build_system_prompt` accepts an optional `goal` parameter and appends the invariant block last (Phase 6)
- `athena/memory.py` refactored into the `athena/memory/` package; legacy workspace-keyed API preserved (Phase 5)
- Agent loop fires plugin lifecycle hooks (`on_session_start`, `on_user_message`, `pre_tool_call`, `post_tool_call`, `on_assistant_message`, `on_session_end`); the existing settings.json hook system in `athena/hooks.py` is unchanged and runs alongside (Phase 5)
- Sub-agent dispatch tool now calls Agent.fork() under the hood
- athena/agent.py split into athena/agent/{core,fork}.py
- athena/skills/ (slash-command handlers) renamed to athena/commands/ to free
  the name for the new file-based skill format
- Agent.run_turn now persists every user / assistant / tool message to the
  session store (JSONL + SQLite FTS5)
- Hermes sessions_importer drives SessionStore so imports land in
  `athena sessions list` and FTS5 search

### Fixed

- **Anthropic message translation** — provider was sending Athena's Ollama-shaped message log (`role:"tool"` for results, `tool_calls` array on assistant turns) straight to `/v1/messages`, which 400'd with `"Unexpected role 'tool'"`. New `_translate_messages` pass converts to Anthropic's content-block shape: assistant turns become `[{"type":"text"},{"type":"tool_use",...}]`, consecutive tool results coalesce into one `role:"user"` message with `tool_result` blocks, missing `tool_use_id` values synthesize paired ids between adjacent call/result turns. Empty assistant turns are dropped entirely (Anthropic rejects empty content arrays AND empty-text blocks). 10 translation tests pin the contract. Surfaced driving Sonnet 4.6 through the calculator e2e and the curator dogfood; same task that took qwen3-coder:30b 130s now completes in 10s.
- **Cross-provider token usage accounting** — `Agent.run_turn` hardcoded Ollama's field names (`prompt_eval_count` / `eval_count`) when accumulating into `Stats`, silently zeroing the counters for every hosted provider whose usage chunk uses the OpenAI convention (`prompt_tokens` / `completion_tokens`). Accept both shapes so `athena status`, the `/cost` slash command, the audit-log cost attribution, and the closed training loop's session-efficiency scoring all keep working without per-provider branching at the call site. Caught by `athena status` reporting `0/0/0` after a Sonnet run that consumed real tokens.
- **Connect-side `OLLAMA_HOST=0.0.0.0` rewrite** — `0.0.0.0` is a server-side *bind* address (Ollama documents it for `ollama serve`); users routinely copy the same env into their client shell and hit `WinError 10049 — requested address is not valid in its context` (Windows) or `EADDRNOTAVAIL` (Linux). `_normalize_ollama_host` now rewrites `0.0.0.0` → `127.0.0.1` and `[::]` → `[::1]` while preserving scheme, port, and pass-through for already-valid hosts. 10 parametrized tests cover IPv4/IPv6 wildcards, scheme-less inputs, and remote-host passthrough.
- **cp1252-safe console output** — `ui.error`'s `✗` glyph (and `↳`, `▰`, etc.) crashed `console.print` with `UnicodeEncodeError` on legacy Windows consoles whose default stdout encoding is cp1252. `athena.ui` now reconfigures `stdout`/`stderr` with `errors="replace"` on win32 and falls back to ASCII variants of the colored unicode symbols when Rich detects the legacy Windows console, so unrepresentable characters degrade to `?` instead of taking down the process.
- **TOML loader merges into typed dataclass fields** — the naive `setattr` loop overwrote `Config.gateway` (a `GatewayConfig` dataclass) with a plain dict when the user had a `[gateway.platforms.telegram]` table; the gateway daemon then crashed on boot with `AttributeError: 'dict' object has no attribute 'continuity'`. `_assign_field` merges TOML tables into the existing dataclass instance field-by-field (recursing one level for nested dataclasses like `GatewayConfig.webhooks`), so unspecified options keep their defaults and downstream code keeps its typed attribute access. 4 new tests pin the merge behavior incl. partial override + unknown-key tolerance.
- **Tool-call parser handles "preamble + naked JSON"** — qwen2.5-coder:14b (and similar coder models) routinely emit a one-line natural-language preamble followed by `{"name": "...", "arguments": {...}}` with no `<tool_call>` wrapper or code fence. `_extract_text_tool_calls` previously handled `<tool_call>` tags, code fences, and whole-text JSON, but missed this exact shape and silently dropped the call. New brace-balanced scan picks up the first balanced `{...}` and accepts it when `_normalize_tool_call` recognizes the shape (name + arguments). Conservative: only matches objects with the tool-call shape, so prose containing literal JSON examples doesn't trip it.
- **Agent.__init__ strips routing prefixes when a provider is passed** — when `fork()` built an auxiliary client and reused the parent's prefixed model name (e.g. `"anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6"`), the prefix went on the wire and Anthropic answered 404 not_found_error. Apply `_bare_model` unconditionally during `Agent.__init__` so the agent's on-the-wire model is always normalized, whether the provider was resolved internally or passed in.
- **Curator headless dogfood path** — `athena curator run --force` against a hosted provider surfaced three additional bugs: the `SimpleNamespace` agent shell was missing `.messages` (fork crashed with AttributeError), the curator fork was called with an empty `user_prompt` so hosted providers responded with empty content (rejected as malformed YAML), and the orchestrator's malformed-output diagnostic conflated "fork error", "empty response", and "schema drift" into a single warning that told the operator nothing. Shim now carries `messages=[]`, curator synthesizes a minimal "Begin the consolidation pass" user turn, and the rejection diagnostic splits the three failure modes so the operator sees which one fired. Validated end-to-end: Sonnet 4.6 fork under `write_origin=curator` correctly emits PRUNE for a placeholder skill while leaving foreground-authored skills untouched (Phase 4 hard rule respected).
- **Skill name validator emits actionable error** — kebab-case enforcement (`^[a-z0-9]+(?:-[a-z0-9]+)*$`) silently dropped skills with snake_case directory names at session start. Error message now detects underscores and uppercase letters in the rejected name and suggests the corrected form (e.g. `"use hyphens instead of underscores (try 'string-utils-style')"`). Behavior unchanged; purely diagnostic. Surfaced driving Sonnet through a multi-file workspace e2e where the workspace skill was being skipped and the model never followed its conventions.
