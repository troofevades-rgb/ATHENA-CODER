# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Renamed
- Project renamed `ocode` → `athena`. The Python package, the `athena`
  CLI command, `~/.athena/` config home, and the `ATHENA.md` project
  context file all move together. The legacy `ocode` CLI entry stays
  as an alias for one release; `~/.athena/` falls back to reading
  `~/.ocode/` when the new home doesn't exist; `ATHENA.md` falls back
  to `OCODE.md`; `OCODE_*` env vars (`MODEL`, `SESSIONS_FSYNC`,
  `SEARCH_BACKEND`, `SEARXNG_URL`, `WEB_TIMEOUT`, `WEB_USER_AGENT`,
  `HOOK_EVENT`, `TOOL_NAME`) are still honored alongside the canonical
  `ATHENA_*`.

### Added
- `Provider` ABC, `StreamChunk` shape, and name-keyed registry under `athena/providers/` (Phase 8)
- `OllamaProvider` (replaces `OllamaClient`) on the new ABC; `ollama_client.py` is now a back-compat shim (Phase 8)

- SFT and DPO dataset construction in JSONL with the qwen-coder chat template (Phase 7)
- Interactive trajectory review TUI with resume; labels persist to `<profile_dir>/labels/<session_id>.json` (Phase 7)
- Training runner wrapping `transform/scripts/train_lora.py` + new `train_dpo.py` (Phase 7)
- `transform/scripts/train_dpo.py` companion to the existing LoRA script (Phase 7)
- Ollama deployment helpers — Modelfile write + `ollama create`, `ollama list` parsing, model switch (Phase 7)
- `athena train {review,build-dataset,run,status}` — closed training loop CLI (Phase 7)
- `athena model {list,switch,info}` (Phase 7)
- `~/.athena/training_state.json` records every training run for `athena train status` (Phase 7)
- `[project.optional-dependencies.train]` extras group (trl, peft, transformers, datasets, accelerate, bitsandbytes) (Phase 7)
- APScheduler-backed cron with `agent` and `watchdog` modes (Phase 6)
- Cron output delivery to `log`, `file:<path>`, or `gateway://...` (gateway stub until Phase 10) (Phase 6)
- `/steer` and `/queue` in-flight redirection — synthetic user messages drained before each prompt, FIFO order (Phase 6)
- `/goal` Ralph-loop invariant persisted at `<profile_dir>/goal.txt` and injected at the end of every system prompt rebuild (Phase 6)
- `athena cron {add,list,remove,enable,disable,run-now,logs,daemon}` CLI (Phase 6)
- `GLOBAL_STEER_QUEUE` thread-safe singleton for cross-thread steer pushes (Phase 6)
- Plugin API with lifecycle hooks (Phase 5)
- `MemoryProvider` ABC; `BuiltinFileProvider` as default (Phase 5)
- Bundled `shell_audit` plugin (Phase 5)
- `athena plugins {list,enable,disable,info}` CLI (Phase 5)
- `Config.plugins` field + `~/.athena/plugins_state.json` for machine-managed enable state (Phase 5)
- Toolset-scoped tool registry (Phase 0)
- ContextVar provenance tracking (Phase 0)
- Agent.fork() as a core primitive (Phase 0)
- Per-thread approval callback for safe fork execution (Phase 0)
- tool check_fn for capability-based tool advertisement (Phase 0)
- agentskills.io-compliant skill format (Phase 1)
- Skill state machine (active/stale/archived) (Phase 1)
- Pinning and archive directory (Phase 1)
- Class-level umbrella architecture (references/templates/scripts) (Phase 1)
- skills_list, skill_view, skill_manage tools (Phase 1)
- athena import-from-hermes for Hermes Agent migration (Phase 1)
- Progressive disclosure of skill catalog in system prompt (Phase 1)
- SessionStore with JSONL persistence and SQLite FTS5 mirror (Phase 2)
- SearchSessions tool for recall (Phase 2)
- athena sessions {list,browse,search,purge} CLI (Phase 2)
- athena reindex command for rebuilding the session FTS5 index (Phase 2)
- Per-profile root at ~/.athena/profiles/<profile>/ (Phase 2)
- Complete Agent.fork() with auxiliary client and stdout/stderr capture (Phase 3)
- Post-write delta lint for .py / .pyi / .json / .yaml / .yml / .toml (Phase 3)
- ForkResult.actions extracted from structured tool results (Phase 3)
- Parent/child session lineage with fork-tree CLI browse (Phase 3)
- Per-turn background review fork (Phase 4)
- Curator with structured YAML output (Phase 4)
- Curator dry-run mode and run reports (run.json + REPORT.md) (Phase 4)
- Deterministic lifecycle transitions at session start (Phase 4)
- .curator_state persistence (Phase 4)
- Provenance enforcement in skill_manage by write_origin (Phase 4)
- athena curator {run, status, pause, resume, inspect-last} CLI (Phase 4)

### Changed
- `tomli-w>=1.0` added as a runtime dep (used by `athena model switch`) (Phase 7)
- `apscheduler>=3.10` + `sqlalchemy>=2.0` added as runtime dependencies (Phase 6)
- Agent loop drains pending steers via `_inject_pending_steers()` before each user prompt (Phase 6)
- `build_system_prompt` accepts an optional `goal` parameter and appends the invariant block last (Phase 6)
- `athena/memory.py` refactored into the `athena/memory/` package; legacy workspace-keyed API preserved (Phase 5)
- Agent loop fires plugin lifecycle hooks (`on_session_start`, `on_user_message`, `pre_tool_call`, `post_tool_call`, `on_assistant_message`, `on_session_end`); the existing settings.json hook system in `athena/hooks.py` is unchanged and runs alongside (Phase 5)
- Sub-agent dispatch tool now calls Agent.fork() under the hood
- athena/agent.py split into athena/agent/{core,fork}.py
- athena/skills/ (slash-command handlers) renamed to athena/commands/ to free
  the name for the new file-based skill format
- Agent.run_turn now persists every user / assistant / tool message to the
  session store (JSONL + SQLite FTS5)
- Hermes sessions_importer drives SessionStore so imports land in
  `athena sessions list` and FTS5 search
