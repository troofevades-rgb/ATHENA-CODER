"""Tests for the GOAL ACHIEVED / GOAL BLOCKED sentinel scanner (T5-07.3).

The scanner is the contract between the model's free-form text
output and the deterministic continuation loop. False positives
(thinking the goal is done when it isn't) are worse than false
negatives — over-eager achievement detection would silently
stop the loop. Tests pin the exact shapes that count and the
shapes that don't.
